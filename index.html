 The Milky Way is formed of many stars, all once hydrogen and helium gas clouds gravitationally attracted to one another due to dark energy. This resulted in a sharp increase
 in the temperature and kinetic energy, allowing the hydrogen atoms to undergo nuclear fusion to form helium and emit photons that release radiation pressure. This fusion process
 is the fuel that allows tecome a stable main seqhe protostar to buence star. Thousands and eventually millions of these stars are formed and create clusters, where the constituents
 of each cluster experience gravitational interactions with each other and the stars change orbit and velocities.

 The age of the Milky Way galaxy we live in is approximately 13.6 billion ± 600 million years old. The Milky Way is an example of what is referred to as a barred spiral galaxy. 
 Before it was a galaxy, it began as a spheroidal large cloud of gases and dark matter that underwent gravitational collapse as the dark matter drew the gases towards its centre. This 
 created a dense mass of high kinetic energy hydrogen atoms that undergo nuclear fusion and release huge amounts of energy.  Radiation from this caused a pressure that stabilises the core’s 
 gravitational forces and would form a star. The formation of hundreds of billions of these stars would become the foundation of the Milky Way galaxy.

 <pre id="FusionParagraph" style="font-size:18px; font-family:inter;" style="text-align: center;">
 When the gases are attracted together by gravitational forces, also known as gravitational collapse, there is work done on the particles of these gases. As a result, their kinetic energy and 
 temperature increase rapidly to the point where denser areas of the gas where there are more particles begin to glow. This creates a core of gas particles called a protostar (O’Neill, M. 2015, pp. 98).
 As more gas is attracted,the temperature rises even further, reaching temperatures of millions of degrees kelvin. Due to the increase in the gas temperature, the hydrogen atoms in the gas can reach a 
 kinetic energy of 3.6 MeV(which is approximately 5.8e-13 joules) and are able to undergo nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion of hydrogen occurs when the nuclei of 2 hydrogen atoms to form a deuterium 
 (a hydrogen isotope that has 2 neutrons, also called hydrogen-2) nucleus, a neutrino and a positron. Positrons released by the fusion are annihilated by making contact with electrons to produce a 
 gamma photon. This nuclei fuses with a hydrogen nucleus to form a helium-3 nucleus and a gamma photon (O’Neill, M. 2015, pp. 223). These steps are repeated to form another helium-3 nucleus. The two
 helium-3 nuclei fuse together to create a helium-4 nucleus and emit 2 protons. The photons are emitted at a high momentum, which creates a radiation pressure that counteracts the gravitational collapse
 of the star’s core and keeps the star stable. Nuclear fusion is the source of fuel for main sequence stars.

 Present in the Milky Way are thousands of star clusters, which are stellar systems formed of many stars. The 3 main types of clusters in the Milky Way are open clusters, globular clusters and stellar associations.
 In the case of the Milky Way, open clusters are more frequent with thousands of known clusters and many more unknown predicted to be present.

 <pre id="Clusters" style="font-size:18px; font-family:inter;" style="text-align: center;">
 Open clusters are formed of both older and younger stars that are more spread out than in globular clusters. However, both are similar in structure and evolution. Their densities are concentrated more towards
 the centre and decrease outwards. This is a result of two body relaxation, a process where a star’s velocity is altered due to gravitational interactions where the star exchanges and transfers gravitational potential
 energy to kinetic energy with other stars within the cluster which changes the orbit of the star. During these interactions, he velocities of high mass stars decrease and reach a lower orbit radius towards the centre
 of the cluster. The velocities of low mass stars increase and are dispersed towards a wider orbit. Referred to as mass segregation, it also explains the escape of low mass stars from the tidal boundary of the star
 cluster as they achieve the escape velocity.   Furthermore, through the evolution of a cluster’s lifespan comes external interactions, such as tidal forces due to giant molecular clouds, interactions with the galactic
 disk and differential rotation in the centre of the cluster. Differential rotation is the difference in angular velocity (rate of rotation) between stars within the cluster.Over time these effects heavily alter the shape
 of the cluster.
  
 Stellar associations are very loosely bound clusters of young stars where all the stars share a common origin but are not gravitationally bound to each other. They are categorised by OB associations made up of young 
 massive stars (15-90x the mass of the Sun for O-type and 2-15x the mass of the Sun for B-type); R associations formed of young, bright stars of 3-10x the size of the Sun and T associations made from young, low mass 
 stars of similar mass to the Sun.
